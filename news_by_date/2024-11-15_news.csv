In this political climate, these qualities are especially important.","When I awoke last week to the news that Donald Trump had been elected president once again, my first impulse was to write. This is not unusual for me. I have been writing my way through difficult times for more than 60 years.It’s what I did after the civil rights battles of the 1960s, the Vietnam War and the Sept. 11 attacks and at the start of the pandemic. At moments of crisis and historical upheaval, it’s easy to doubt that good writing can possibly help fix the many ills of the world. But whenever I have found myself lost in anger or anguish or confusion, the answer for how I could get through it was the same: Put pen to paper.In my experience, good writing requires four things: precision of language, the freedom to say anything, respect and — perhaps most important — love. The responsibilities of the writer today are no different from those of any writer in any age. But the presence, character and now considerable power of President-elect Trump make the work of fulfilling those responsibilities all the more difficult and urgent.","Good writing requires four things: precision, freedom, respect and love.
