How could he talk? After all, there is a blur where his mouth should be — an effect that is poetically rendered in Carl Joseph Papa’s animated film, which used the rotoscoping technique to trace drawings over its live cast. Not that anybody appears to notice anything amiss with Eric’s face, including his mother, Rosalinda (Dolly De Leon, a Golden Globe nominee for “Triangle of Sadness”), and his sweet co-worker Carlo (Gio Gahol), who may be flirting. In flashbacks told in childlike scrawls, we see Eric being taken by aliens, who turn out to be more inquisitive than hostile. He escapes, but they haunt his memories and likely are the key to his silence.","This month’s picks include a heart-wrenching animated Filipino film, a yeasty savior and the return of Carrie-Anne Moss.",Culture,2024-11-22
