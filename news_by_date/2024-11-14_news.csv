(Its leaves are also edible.) Known in Peru by its Quechua name, kiwicha, it was domesticated by Andean peoples some 3,000 years ago and later became a source of sustenance for the Incas and their contemporaries. (A different variety of amaranth was grown by the Aztecs of Mexico.) But the 16th-century Spanish colonizers, writes Jamaica Kincaid in “An Encyclopedia of Gardening for Colored Children” (2024), forced the Incas and the Aztecs to abandon their crops and replace them “with barley, wheat and other European grains.”","Once a mainstay of Indigenous diets, the South American crop is having a resurgence in popularity, in part because of its health benefits.",TStyle,2024-11-14

The Sri Lankan lotus farmer was in his late 40s, with dark, leathery skin, a graying soul patch and lips stained red from betel nut. He placed his phone in the branches and gestured to me to remove my shoes. The grass felt like rubber under my feet on that February morning. Mud oozed between my toes. “Pankaja,” I murmured to myself, “mud born.” It is one of over 40 words for the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo nucifera) in Sanskrit. I rolled my corduroys up to my knees and we began to wade into the lake, which Asoka, whose full name is Y.G.W. Dissinayake, had rented for cultivation. The rising sun suffused the thin mist that hung over the water. We soon stood in several inches of soft mud and murky water, surrounded by a colony of lotuses. There were calyxes of faded pink, others in full bloom, with yellowish-white interiors and petals of translucent brightness, sheltered by broad, nodding leaves and curled, elliptical buds. Most beguiling of all was the fruiting receptacle. It looked like something that a spacecraft might have jettisoned as it breached the Earth’s atmosphere — a magical cup of unbelievable hardiness in whose waxy surface the beanlike seeds of the lotus lay embedded, with the power to fruit even after a thousand years.","The flower has developed a deep national importance, but what exactly it signifies depends on whom you ask.",TStyle,2024-11-14

Wanderers of its peaks, valleys and dunes might miss the Protea nana, also known as the skaamblom, or “shy flower,” because its bell-shaped blooms advance downward into the brush, but there are plenty of other species to see. (The name “protea” comes from the shape-shifting Greek god Proteus.) There’s the Pink Mink, whose petals are tipped with black hairs; the spiky-soft pincushion protea, with its dome of protruding styles; and the King protea, characterized by an oversize inflorescence featuring a ring of bracts surrounding an orblike grouping of velvety florets.",The resilient species — which regrow after wildfires — are said to capture the spirit of a nation reborn.,TStyle,2024-11-14

That’s especially true in Papua New Guinea, where the scale and diversity of orchids holds a mirror to the country itself, which is home to some 850 distinct languages and about as many tribes.

2024-11-14 10:02:20+00:00,How the World’s Most Expensive Spice Is Grown,A glimpse at Kashmir’s saffron harvest.,"Its vibrant purple petals notwithstanding, the saffron flower (Crocus sativus) is valued primarily for what hides beneath those petals: tiny, fiery orange stamens that, once plucked and processed, become the world’s most expensive spice, one that adds sweet flavor and deep golden color to dishes as culinarily disparate as Spanish paella, South Asian pulao and Swedish St. Lucia buns. Known botanically as a triploid owing to its three sets of chromosomes, the saffron crocus can neither grow wild nor reproduce without human intervention. Instead the plant must be propagated and harvested manually, a laborious undertaking that Bronze Age Greeks are believed to have pioneered and that helps account for its price. Today saffron is grown in a latitudinal belt that runs from the Mediterranean to South Asia, with Iran currently contributing about 85 percent of the global supply. But saffron from Kashmir is arguably the most highly prized, says Sana Javeri-Kadri, whose seven-year-old Oakland, Calif.-based spice business, Diaspora Spice Co., sources its inventory from a small family farm in the Kashmiri town of Pampore, where the flowers have been cultivated since at least the 12th century. Harvested between late October and early November, the saffron there grows alongside apricots and almonds in particularly porous soil that’s fed by nutrient-rich snowmelt all spring. The result is an extra-potent crop redolent of almonds and honey that’s hand-processed, with each individual stamen massaged to bring its natural oils to the surface. The beauty of the valley during the saffron bloom, she says, is almost otherworldly. “The light is buttery yellow, the leaves of the fruit trees are bright orange and the ground is blanketed in purple flowers,” says Javeri-Kadri, who has attended Pampore’s fall harvest for three years running. “I’ve never seen those colors together in nature before. It’s stunning.”",A glimpse at Kashmir’s saffron harvest.,TStyle,2024-11-14

Corey.","Horace Walpole wrote that “history is a romance that is believed; romance, a history that is not believed.” Minsoo Kang’s THE MELANCHOLY OF UNTOLD HISTORY (Morrow, 228 pp., $28) engages with that tension, unfolding in three distinct registers: a horror-inflected narrative of a raconteur about to be killed by his emperor, a mythic tale of discord between the gods, and a story of a recently bereaved present-day history professor. The braiding of these narrative strands invites us to question who, in the grand scheme of things, is telling stories about whom.","Recent books by Minsoo Kang, Margaret Killjoy and James S.A.

Now, the ritual’s also become a photo op.","The lotus may be Vietnam’s national flower but, in the country’s Mekong Delta, it’s the waterlily, a similar though unrelated plant, that draws crowds of visitors to witness its harvest each fall. For several weeks between August and November, depending on the intensity of the year’s monsoons, farmers and other locals, mostly women, wade through murky shallows at dawn to collect the day-blooming Nymphaea nouchali and the night-blooming Nymphaea rubra, the two varieties most commonly found in Africa and Asia. There are roughly 85 species in the waterlily family, Nymphaeaceae, native to temperate and tropical climates around the world and descendants of the planet’s oldest flowering plants. Fossilized seeds found in northern Japan in 1997 are believed to be about 85 million years old. In ancient Egypt, pharaohs, including King Tutankhamen (circa 1341-23 B.C.), were buried with blue waterlilies. A staple of the culture (used for food and medicine), the flowers also symbolized immortality and were said to have been valued for their psychedelic properties during funeral rites.","In the Mekong Delta, farmers and locals still gather the flowers on wooden boats.
