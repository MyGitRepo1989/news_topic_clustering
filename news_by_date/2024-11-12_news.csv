Though Pauling and Ossipoff had hardly spoken before their meeting, he decided to roll up his sleeves and help fix the delicate cylindrical lantern. As Pauling shared his dreams of building an elemental house from locally sourced materials with lots of space for books and an open kitchen, dining and sitting room where he could cook and converse with friends and family, a bond that would span generations was born. By the end of their meeting, the two men had not only mended the lampshade (Ossipoff’s granddaughter donated it to the Noguchi Museum in New York City this past July) but Ossipoff had sketched the beginnings of Pauling’s house, which would be successfully completed within just a couple of years.","This hexagonal home, hidden on an Oahu mountaintop, is the best example of Vladimir Ossipoff’s blend of Japanese and American midcentury design.",TStyle,2024-11-12
