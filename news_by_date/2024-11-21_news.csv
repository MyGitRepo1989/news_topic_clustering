A last-minute midwife’s letter would not do.","On the evening of July 19, six members of my family were set to fly La Compagnie, a French business-class-only airline, from Newark Liberty International Airport to Nice, France, for a long-planned trip that included the Paris Olympics. When my husband and I arrived at the airport, the other four had already gone through security. The La Compagnie agent congratulated me on my (obvious) pregnancy and asked how far along I was. I answered truthfully: 28 weeks and a day. She said I needed a letter from my doctor saying I was OK to fly. But every doctor and midwife I had spoken to about the trip reassured me it was safe, including the midwife I saw the day before at my 28-week checkup. Even though she was attending someone else’s labor that evening, she managed to send a letter, first through a patient portal and then via email directly to La Compagnie, along with her provider identifier number and, when the staff insisted, a photo of her hospital ID. But even after I did everything they asked, the agent told me the crew had determined I could not board. The La Compagnie desk was closing for the night, and the agent gave me a number to call to rebook. But with no guarantee I would be able to fly, even if there were seats available in the coming days, we booked a flight for the next evening on Air France for about $6,560 each — a steep increase from our $3,530 La Compagnie tickets. La Compagnie offered to return the original $3,530 each, but I believe they were wrong to deny us boarding and should compensate us for the cost of the last-minute flight instead. Can you help?

To create arrangements for a lighting exhibition organized by the design firm Roman and Williams that opened this week in TriBeCa, she and her team at Field Studies Flora worked with SpadaFlora, a foraging company in New Jersey, to source “incredible twisty branches,” she says, while coppery spider chrysanthemums came from the Hudson Valley’s Treadlight Farm. On a 15-foot-tall Christmas tree spangled with red ribbon at Roman and Williams’s SoHo boutique, Crowder hung ornaments made from spiky datura seed pods and clusters of pine cones adorned with acorns. “We had an excess of them in the studio from other holiday projects,” says Crowder of the materials, “and we were trying to figure out, ‘How do we reuse these in a new, interesting way?’” She’s now selling the two designs through her website, along with a cocoon-like diamond of lichen, all strung from black velvet ribbons. Crowder’s aim, with the ornaments and her floral business as a whole, is to “draw people’s attention to materials that are often overlooked,” she says.","A roundup of unusual Christmas baubles, from diamonds made of lichen to glass flowers and strawberry tarts.",TStyle,2024-11-21
