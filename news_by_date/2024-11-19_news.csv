But a couch typically “occupies prime real estate” in a room, says the decorator Alexandra Pappas, 47, of Pappas Miron Design — meaning it’s worth thinking about its visual appeal, too.

For practical advice on creating a similarly inviting layered effect, we spoke to a handful of interior designers who have perfected the art.",Expert advice from interior designers on going beyond the standard two-pillows-and-a-throw treatment.,TStyle,2024-11-19
